Logistics lane quotes will produce a current market price for a lane that will help determine the final offering price to a customer and/or carrier.
A pickup and delivery location will be entered and a price range will be produced based on the market at that time.

https://www.dat.com/ is the site intended to be used with the code but is only available through a work computer.

Yahoo Finance will be the place holder site since the code requires a site locked behind a work computer.
